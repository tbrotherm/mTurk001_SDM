<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>We will pay you $10 for your study participation. In this task, your actions will determine the rewards that you and your partner will receive at the end of the experiment. It is possible that you and your partner gain bonus rewards OR that you and your partner lose some money from your participation payment.</p>
<p>The task is a simple gambling task: You will see three pairs of two cards on screen, and you have to choose one pair. You are the only person performing this task. Your partner has been assigned to complete a different task. Importantly, only this gambling task will determine the bonus rewards that you and your partner receive.</p>
<p>Each block of this gambling task has 50 trials. You will perform two blocks, so in total, you will do this task 100 times. We will show you three pairs of two cards, from which you will choose one pair. After you choose a pair, the amount of money that you and your partner have gained/lost will be shown separately on the screen. There are five types of monetary outcomes: (i) gain $2, (ii) gain $1, (iii) neither gain nor lose any money, (iv) lose $1, (v) lose $2. One of these five outcomes will be randomly assigned to each card. There is no rule as to how they are assigned. After showing each card’s outcome separately, a summary of the trial will be shown, and you must choose to either accept (i.e., “save”) this outcome or to reject it and try again (i.e., again) for a different outcome. In the case that you choose to accept the outcome, the outcome of both cards will be recorded for you and your partner. In the case that you reject the outcome and choose to try again, the outcomes of both cards will be discarded. All accepted outcomes are saved on the computer. We will tell you the final result of all outcomes for both you and your partner once you have finished each block.
Please press the button as quickly as possible when selecting one of the three pairs of cards and when you choose accept or reject an outcome, but try to avoid making errors. If a certain period of time elapses without a button being pressed, the screen will show a “no response” message. If this occurs, the trail will be cancelled, so please be sure to respond in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>When you finish the second block, roll the dice. If you roll an odd number, the result of the first block will be counted as the bonus reward. If you roll an even number, the result of second block will be counted as the bonus reward. If the total outcome of the selected block is a positive number, we will add this number to your participation payment as bonus reward. If the total outcome of the selected block is a negative number, we will deduct this number from your participation payment. We will use the same rule for your partner’s payment.</p>
